## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082), offering a balance between intellectual sophistication and calm focus. It suggests knowledge, concentration, and contemplation, ideal for a learning environment. It's dark enough to contrast well against light text and other elements.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#E6E6FA), creates a soothing backdrop that is easy on the eyes during extended use.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), adds vibrancy to CTAs, progress bars, or highlights, drawing the userâ€™s attention to these elements. This contrast makes the app more engaging while sticking to a harmonious, analogous palette.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a stylish serif, evokes design, art, and fashion. Body Font: 'Alegreya', also a serif, is highly readable and offers an elegant counterpoint to Belleza. If the text has short passages only, the 'Belleza' font alone can be used, as well. This creates a sophisticated and engaging appearance for the educational context.
- Use clear and minimalist icons for navigation and controls; employ a consistent line thickness and style for a cohesive visual language. The color should follow the chosen color palette and should be easy to distinguish from the background.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout; ensure the quiz question and answer choices are easily viewable, and user interface elements such as timers and navigation are placed logically on the screen for ease of access. Prioritize responsiveness to ensure accessibility across different device sizes.
- Use subtle animations for transitions between questions and providing feedback to the user such as progress indicators or result highlights, enhancing user engagement without being distracting. Use fade in and fade out animation style.
